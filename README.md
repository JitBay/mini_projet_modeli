Mini Projet Modélisation Géométrique - Unity Simulation
Overview
This project is a Unity-based simulation that immerses the user in a tactical scenario where they must protect a strategic location against a group of rioters. The simulation is designed to teach tactical decision-making, emotional management, and ethical considerations in crowd control scenarios.

Features
Tactical Simulation: Manage distances, crowd density, and strategic positioning.
Grenade System: Implement realistic grenade throwing physics, including trajectory and environmental interactions.
Real-Time Mesh Deformation: Objects such as cars and urban furniture deform upon interaction with grenades.
Particle System for Smoke Grenades: Realistic and optimized smoke effects.
AI Behavior: Simulated rioters navigate the environment and respond dynamically to smoke grenades.
Animations: Vehicles and pedestrians move naturally through the scene.
Shaders: Visual traces of explosions with custom shaders.
Scenario Outcomes:
Success: Rioters are blocked from progressing.
Failure: Explosives hit the user or the protected area is abandoned.
Bonus:
Main Menu for launching the game.
Sound effects for vehicles, explosions, and city ambiance.
Requirements
Unity Version: Unity 2022 or above is required to run this project.
How to Run the Simulation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copier le code
git clone https://github.com/JitBay/mini_projet_modeli.git
Open the project in Unity 2022 or newer.
Set the Menu Scene as the starting scene in Unity's build settings:
Go to File > Build Settings.
Add all scenes to the build.
Ensure the Menu Scene is at the top of the list.
Press Play in the Unity Editor or build and run the project.
Objectives
Gameplay:
Navigate the avatar (CRS) in a simulated urban environment.
Prevent rioters from accessing a protected zone.
Use grenades to control the crowd while minimizing collateral damage.
Key Assets Used
Urban Environment: Demo City by Versatile Studio
Third-Person Controller: Third-Person Controller (Basic Locomotion)
